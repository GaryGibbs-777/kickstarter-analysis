# kickstarter-analysis
# Kickstarter Project Overview
The purpoose of this is to give Lousie visual representation of the data from her campaign for her play **Fever** and how her campaign has fared in terms of her funding goals, completion dates, and the like for her Kickstarter campaign. The following information will provide a visual for Louise. And She will be able to see how other plays like hers has fared in Kickstarter campaigns too.
# Deliverable 1: Theater outcomes based on the Launch Date 
I used the "data-1-1-3-StarterBook.xlsx" and I did the previous exercises in canvas which was a huge help. After completed that, I created a new tab from the the theater ouctimes by Launch Data. Since, Louise wanted to know how other theare campiagns fared on Kickstrter. So, I created a pivot table to display a graph based on the number of successful, failed, and canceld Kickstarter campaigns based on the months of the year.

As you can see the best time to start a kickstarter campaign for plays would be during the summer when people want to get out of the house and go to the movies or see a play, and go on dates. The best month to do this in in May and the worse month to do a Kickstarter for a play would be in the winter time in December. When just about everyone wants to stay inside and keep warm.

# Deliverable 2: Outcomes based on goals
The graph below shows the percentage of Kickstarter campaigns beased on their funding goals by percentage. As the graph shows Louise should have a funding goal of less than a $1,000 for the best results.

**Challenges**
The firs deliverable was pretty hard for me to get what to do with the COUNTIFS function, but that video that was included with the challege was very helpful. But debuging syntax errors was very time consuming. With that said, the video included in the challenge was very helpful and it felt good getting past this part. As for deliverable, setting up the chart was the toughest part for me. Since I thought we would need to use a pivot chart, but I could not get the right order I wanted. So, I just used a plan old chart and that did the trick.

# limitations of this dataset
I wouldn't mind knowing how well plays in May compete with summer movies coming out at the time and that would be beneficial to anyone thinking about finding funding for plays.

# Results
**Theater Outcomes by Launch Date**
May is the best time to for Louise to hit the ground running with her kickstarter campaign. Since as I said eariler, most people want to get out of their homes/apartments and go to the movies and have some fun. That is a double edged sword though. Since, that is when Hollywood is sending in their gaint franchises like Docotor Strange, Spider-Man, Batman, and many more blockbusters. So, the competiion will be tough.

**Outcomes based on Goals**
Based on the Outcomes based on Goals graph it would be best for Louise to set a goal of less than $1,000 for her Kickstarter campaign. 

**Other tables and grpahs to add**
I would add a pie chart for both deliverables since, I think that it the most known and easiest to follow out of all of the graphs.
